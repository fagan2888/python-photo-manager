#Python photo manager#

##Introducition##
There are two general approaches for managing a large photo collection: 
1.  Use an ordered folder structure
2.  Use a dedicated photo management program, like Picasa or one of many others.

However, chosing between these options is not easy as it poses a dilemma:  folder structure is 'future-proof', but is very difficult to maintain by hand in a coherent manner. Dedicated photo management applications tend to lock the user into a single piece of software, with the certainity that the application and its database will be outdated some time in the future. 
This has recieved some attention on [ask slashdot](http://ask.slashdot.org/story/14/12/14/2033201/ask-slashdot-best-software-for-image-organization) with a lively discussion.

In my personal experience I have tried  different photo management tools in the past (ACDsee, Picasa, XnView etc), but what I really needed was a well-organized folder structure. In the meantime my photo collection has grown to ~22000 photos, all with very generic names like `IMG_1180.JPG` . They sit in an organic folder structure with no coherent naming. After I started sorting the collection by hand, I quickly realized that it would take me days if not weeks, involve multiple tools for photo renaming. Even worse, with a big risk of making a mistake and loosing precious photos.

So I decided to invest some time into developing a photo mangagement toolset to accomplish this task and make it easy in the future.

## Current status ##

the code is very much work in progress and is not fully functional yet. It can be however used as a starting point for tinkering. Updates will follow along the way.
